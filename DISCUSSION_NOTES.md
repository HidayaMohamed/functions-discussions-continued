1.What happens when you skip middle parameters?
- We would use default values when a parameter isnt always required/ it is optional.
When You have to configure objects/ allowing users to override certain settings.

2. Default values avoid repetition 
it also improves user experience.

3. - How is storing a function in a variable different from storing a number?
-When storing a number/string in a variable u r storing a primitive value directly while storing a function in a variable u r storing a reference to the function's code in memory.
